List is type of collection.
In lists we can store multiple values.
Lists are mutable. Values inside a list can be changed. 

split() - breaks a string in to list. it removes the spaces. split looks for spaces in a string so if we use 'this;is;a;string' this will be a single list item. We can tell spilt where we want to split using split(;)
